          <h2>Identify the construction works</h2>
          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(a) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must identify the construction work or related goods and services to which it relates.</p>

          <details class="statute-excerpt">
            <summary>Section 68(1)(a) BIF Act â€“ Meaning of payment claim</summary>
            <div class="statute-body">
              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(a) &nbsp;identifies the construction work or related goods and services to which the progress payment relates; and</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>General principles</h3>
          <p>The test is not whether the claim explains every calculation, but whether the relevant construction work (and/or related goods and services) is sufficiently identified such that the basis of the claim is reasonably comprehensible to the recipient. In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) said (adopting <em>T & M Buckley Pty Ltd v 57 Moss Road Pty Ltd</em> [2010] QCA 381):</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[24]</span> In determining whether or not a document identifies the work, goods and services to which the claim relates, the Courts take a practical, and not overly technical, attitude. In <em>T & M Buckley Pty Ltd v 57 Moss Road Pty Ltd</em> Philippides J, writing in this Court, said that the issue for determination was, "â€¦ not whether the payment claim explained in every respect the means by which a particular claim item had been calculated, but whether the relevant construction work or related goods and services was sufficiently identified â€¦ That is, whether the payment claim reasonably identified the construction work to which it related such that the basis of the claim was reasonably comprehensible to the applicant." It has been accepted by the Courts that, in deciding whether or not work has been sufficiently identified, the background of each of the parties "derived from their past dealings and exchanges of documentation" is to be taken into account.</p>
          </div>

          <p>In ascertaining whether the identification of construction work is reasonably comprehensible to the recipient, the following matters are usually relevant (among others, discussed below):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The fact that payment claims are often "given and received by people experience in the building industry" and that the level of description might reflect that. <em>Vanbeelen v Blackbird Energy Pty Ltd</em> [2006] QDC 285, [37] (Brabazon KC DCJ) citing McDougall J in <em>Isis Projects v Clarence Street</em> [2004] NSWSC 714, [36]â€“[38].</li>
            <li>The parties' background knowledge. "It is appropriate to take into account the background knowledge of the parties derived from their past dealings and exchanges of information". <em>Mackie Pty Ltd v Counahan</em> [2013] VSC 694, [46] (Vickery J); <em>Neumann Contractors Pty Ltd v Peet Beachton Syndicate Ltd</em> [2011] 1 Qd R 17, [25].</li>
            <li>If the payment claim is claiming for items that are mentioned in the construction contract, their identity may be able to be ascertained by reference to the contract. See the observations of McDougall J in <em>Multiplex Construction Pty Ltd v Luikens</em> [2003] NSWSC 1140, [37] approved in <em>Clarence Street Pty Ltd v Isis Projects Pty Ltd</em> (2005) 64 NSWLR 448, 455-6; [2005] NSWCA 391, [33] cited in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [58] (Brown J):</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[37]</span> In principle, I think, the requirement in s 13(2)(a) that a payment claim must identify the construction work to which the progress payment relates is capable of being satisfied where:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(1) The payment claim gives an item reference which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is to be taken as referring to the contractual or other identification of the work;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(2) That reference is supplemented by a single line item description of the work;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(3) Particulars are given of the amount previously completed and claimed and the amount now said to be complete;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(4) There is a summary that pulls all the details together and states the amount claimed.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Degree of particularity in identifying construction works</h3>
          <p>The construction work (or related goods and services) must be identified with some degree of particularity. That is, the specific work the subject of the claim should be identified, rather than simply the general work that is the subject of the construction contract as a whole: <em>Jemzone Pty Ltd v Trytan Pty Ltd</em> (2002) 42 ACSR 42; [2002] NSWSC 395, [43].</p>

          <p>The respondent should be capable of determining whether or not to pay the claim. "There must be sufficient specificity in the payment claim for its recipient actually to be able to identify a payment claim for the purpose of determining whether to pay": <em>Nepean Engineering Pty Ltd v Total Process Services Pty Ltd (in liq)</em> [2005] NSWCA 409, [47]â€“[48] (Santow JA); see also <em>Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd</em> [2008] FCA 1248, [12] (Finkelstein J) cited in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [52] (Brown J); see alike observations in <em>Richard Kirk Architect Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corp</em> [2012] QSC 117, [29] (Daubney J).</p>

          <p>However, determining whether the construction work has been sufficiently "identified" should not be approached in an unduly technical manner: <em>Hawkins Construction (Aust) Pty Ltd v Macs Industrial Pipework Pty Ltd</em> [2002] NSWCA 136, [20] (Davies AJA).</p>

          <p>If the payment claim merely consists of a few failures to identify construction work, but by and large the work is properly identified, the payment claim may not necessarily be invalid: <em>Nepean Engineering Pty Ltd v Total Process Services Pty Ltd (in liq)</em> [2005] NSWCA 409, [37] (Santow J).</p>

          <h3>Factual and mathematical errors</h3>
          <p>Generally, whether the works have been sufficiently "identified" for the purpose of section 68(1)(a) is not to be assessed by reference to whether the payment claim is factually correct or has been calculated strictly in accordance with the contract: <em>Denbrook Constructions Pty Ltd v CBO Developments Pty Ltd</em> [2022] QDC 184, [66] (Porter KC DCJ).</p>

          <p>Additionally, if the payment claim has some mathematical errors, that will not of itself invalidate the payment claim, unless the errors are of a nature which renders or contributes to the payment claim being incomprehensible. <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [43] (Brown J).</p>

          <h3>History of paying similar payment claims may be indicative of sufficient identification</h3>
          <p>In <em>Isis Projects Pty Ltd v Clarence Street Pty Ltd</em> [2004] NSWSC 714, Clarence Street (Developer) and Isis Projects (Builder) enter into a construction contract to refurbish and fit out a building at 50 Clarence Street, Sydney NSW 2000. The Developer failed to pay in full, or serve payment schedules in response to, payment claims 12 and 13 (PC12 and PC13), which consisted of a cover sheet and a tax invoice describing the work by one line items, and showing for each the original contract value, the amount of previous claims, the value of work to date and the percentage completed. The Developer contended PC12 and PC13 were not valid. The Builder contended the PCs were valid and the Developer's failure to issue payment schedules meant the PCs were payable in full. The Court held that the previous conduct of the Developer in having paid 11 previous payment claims of a similar nature showed that the Developer was capable of finding meaning in the Builder's identification of the works. Thus, that conduct supported the conclusion that PC12 and PC13 sufficiently identified the construction work to which their respective payment claims relate. See the findings of McDougal J at [38]:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[38]</span> Where payment claims in that format have been used, apparently without objection, on 11 previous occasions, it is very difficult to understand how the use of the same format on the 12th and 13th occasions could be said not to comply with the requirements of s 13(2)(a). If payments claims in that format had sufficiently identified the construction work to which the progress payment claimed related on 11 previous occasions, I find it hard to understand how they would lose that character on the 12th and 13th occasion.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Case examples of what is not sufficient</h3>
          <h4>MWB Everton Park</h4>
          <p>Percentages against broad trade headings without tethering to identifiable scopes/locations/activities will usually fail. In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Court held a trade-summary/percentage approach did not identify the work for a 56-townhouse project:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[25]</span> â€¦The contract was for the construction of 56 townhouses. In those circumstances, it was all but meaningless to say that 5% of concreting or 12% of plumbing had been completed. More description was needed if the document was to sufficiently identify the construction work, related goods and services, for the purpose of s 68(1)(a).</p>
          </div>

          <p>That approach reflects Brown J's analysis in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, where a one-page "trade breakdown" with only categories and percentages â€“ no particulars of the actual work â€“ failed the identification limb:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[64]</span> â€¦ Whatever form of claim a claimant chooses to adopt, it must identify in a reasonable way the construction work to which the claim relates. While the purpose of the scheme is to permit the quick resolution of payment claims, the claimant must at least be reasonably comprehensible, to permit the respondent to respond within the time frame provided under the Act. The payment claim in this case has failed to do so.</p>
          </div>

          <h4>KDV Sport</h4>
          <p>The judgment in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178 helpfully provides an excerpt of the payment claim which, in that case, was found not to have identified the construction work to which it related:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> â€¦ The payment claim submitted by Muggeridge consisted of a one page document.[25] It contained 6 columns. The first was headed "trade breakdown", the second "Total Amount", the third "Total Paid to Date", the fourth "Total Claim % to Date", the fifth "Total Claimed Trade to Date" and the sixth "Progress Claim". An extract of the payment claim submitted, highlighting particular items which have been the subject of submissions, is as follows:</p>

          <p>Specifically, at [37] â€“ [38] of <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, Brown J gave examples of line items which were inadequately described:</p>

          <h3>Adjudication examples</h3>
          <p><strong><strong>MSS Projects (NSW) Pty Ltd v CPB BAM Ghella UGL JV</strong> (Adj No 2658135)</strong> â€“ The document had clear front-matter and a contract summary, then line-item tables under specific categories showing unit, quantity, rate, completed-to-date and completed-this-period, with brief variation notes and attachments tied to the pricing schedule. Only defined categories were claimed for the period, and the descriptions and figures aligned with Annexure A/H so the respondent could understand and check them. Accordingly, the adjudicator found section 68(1)(a) was satisfied.</p>

          <p><strong><strong>Verus Construction Pty Ltd v Tripple J. T Pty Ltd</strong> (Adj No 925538)</strong> â€“ The adjudicator found the claim failed to satisfy section 68(1)(a) because the monthly "work done" descriptions were broad labels with no particulars, so the basis of the claim was not reasonably comprehensible. He noted the EOT component was shown only by three red lines on a one-page program and a separate daily rate sheet, which did not give sufficient particulars of either the EOTs or the resulting delay costs. The variations were described over one or two pages but then referred to other invoices and documents that were not included with the claim, so the supporting detail was missing. Accordingly, the adjudicator found he did not have jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong><strong>YFA Pty Ltd v Advanced Buildings (Queensland) Pty Ltd</strong> (Adj No 1067253)</strong> â€“ The "payment claim" was essentially a tax invoice (INV-2313, 31 March 2021) tied to a purchase order, with no particulars of what work was done, where, or when (no measurements, locations, period, drawings or calculations). The document did not "clearly, reasonably and adequately" identify the construction work to which it related. On that basis and for other reasons, the adjudicator found he did not have jurisdiction.</p>
        
          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use location + scope + activity + period for every line (e.g., "Tower 1, L10â€“L12: install grid & tile to corridors â€“ 1 January 2025 to 10 January 2025").</li>
            <li>Anchor to the contract: cite the contract/Annexure item ID, unit, quantity, rate, previously approved and this period columns.</li>
            <li>Avoid percentages against broad trades ("Electrical 15%"); make it findable on site with concrete descriptors.</li>
            <li>Keep all supporting documents with the claim (drawings/marked-ups, delivery dockets, photos) and ensure the text of the claim itself makes sense without hunting prior claims.</li>
            <li>For supply-only items, specify units/tonnage/quantities, delivery dates/locations, and what remains to supply (if any).</li>
            <li>Variations, delay costs claims, etc. should ideally be communicated by project letter to the respondent first, and then that correspondence should be referred (and attached) to the payment claim.</li>

          <h2>State the claimed amount</h2>

          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(b) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must state the amount of the progress payment (i.e. the claimed amount) that the claimant claims is payable by the respondent.</p>

              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(b) &nbsp;states the amount (the claimed amount) of the progress payment that the claimant claims is payable by the respondent; and</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>Must state a claimed amount</h3>
          <p>To avoid ambiguity, a payment claim should clearly identify a single, specific figure as the "claimed amount". Failing to state the claimed amount may invalidate the payment claim, even if the total amount of the payment claim is ascertainable by summing individual items claimed.</p>

          <h3>Avoid stating multiple figures that could be construed as the claimed amount</h3>
          <p>Similarly, a payment claim should avoid presenting multiple figures that could each be read as the "claimed amount". In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Queensland Court of Appeal found that an email and multiple spreadsheets did not state a single claimed amount. The spreadsheets showed different "due this claim" totals for separable parts of the works, and the project summary failed to state the total cumulative claim. Because there was no clearly identified, single claimed amount, the package of documents did not constitute a valid payment claim under the BIF Act (at [27]â€“[33]).</p>

          <p>Having said this, there is authority under the predecessor <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld) suggesting that it is sufficient for a payment claim to state multiple amounts which collectively constitute the claimed amount. See the observations of Henry J in <em>Camporeale Holdings Pty Ltd v Mortimer Construction Pty Ltd</em> [2015] QSC 211, especially at [32]:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[32]</span> The applicant submitted the covering email here should have cited a single total amount claimed. However, it is obvious when the documents are considered together that the amount claimed was the total of the four amounts stated in the invoices. The absence of a statement of the mathematical total of those amounts does not make the statements of the four amounts considered in combination any less a statement of the amount of the progress payment claimed. I am fortified in reaching that conclusion by s 32C of the <em>Acts Interpretation Act 1954</em> (Qld) which provides that in an act words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. Thus a payment claim which states the amounts of the progress payment claimed to be payable will comply with s 17(2)(b), as long as those amounts are stated as part of one payment claim.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Where applicable, the claimed amount should be GST inclusive</h3>
          <p>To the extent GST applies, best practice is to express the claimed amount as the GST inclusive figure. While the issue has not been tested before a court, expressing a claimed amount as GST exclusive may expose the payment claim to an argument that the GST component is not part of the payment claim.</p>

          <h2>Request payment</h2>

          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must request payment of the claimed amount.</p>

          <details class="statute-excerpt">

            <div class="statute-body">
              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(c) &nbsp;requests payment of the claimed amount.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The requirement to request payment of the claimed amount was introduced under the BIF Act in lieu of the former requirement under the <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld) to state that the payment claim was made under the Act. Most jurisdictions other than Queensland (e.g. New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory) still require an express endorsement under their respective security of payment acts.</p>

          <h3>"Invoice" is sufficient</h3>
          <p>For the purpose of satisfying section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act, it is sufficient to include the word "invoice" on the face of the payment claim (section 68(3) of the BIF Act). It would appear that the payment claim does not have to, in fact, be a legitimate tax invoice; however, if the claimant intends to rely on including the word "invoice" for the purpose of requesting payment, best practice would be to ensure the payment claim satisfies the requirements of a valid tax invoice under section 29.70 of the <em>A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999</em> (Cth).</p>

          <h3>"Amount due this claim" is not sufficient</h3>
          <p>In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Queensland Court of Appeal held that the words "amount due this claim" was not sufficient to request payment. At [35], Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) stated:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> The respondent's argument that the words "amount due this claim" were a request for payment must be rejected. The statement of the "amount due this claim" was an identification by the builder of the progress payment which it claimed was payable by the principal. That identification was required by s 68(1)(b). Something more was required by s 68(1)(c); there had to be a request for payment of the amount claimedâ€¦.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Request for payment must be express or necessarily and clearly implied</h3>
          <p>In the same decision (<em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94), the Queensland Court of Appeal also held that for something to amount to a "request" for payment, it must be either expressly stated in the payment claim, or necessarily and clearly implied:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> â€¦It might be accepted that no particular form of words is necessary. However, something which amounts to a request for payment needs either to be express in the document or necessarily, and clearly, implied in the document. Here, I cannot see that there was anything in the email and attachments of 30 June 2023 which requested payment.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Endorsement under the BIF Act might not be sufficient</h3>
          <p>As mentioned above, section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act was introduced to replace the previous requirement to expressly state that the payment claim was made under the <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld). In practice, many Queensland payment claims still contain an endorsement under the legislation.</p>

          <p>In <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 16, the Supreme Court of Queensland found that a document that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>was titled "Victoria and Albert Broadbeach Progress Claim";</li>
            <li>included words such as "Total progress claim value";</li>
            <li>was endorsed under the BIF Act, having stated "This Progress Claim is submitted under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017"; and</li>
            <li>was accompanied by a statutory declaration in relation to the payment of "Progress Claim No 7",</li>
          </ul>
          <p>amounted to an implied request for payment (see [139] to [142]).</p>

          <p>However, the Queensland Court of Appeal in <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94 casted doubt over whether those four factors were indeed sufficient to "request payment of the claimed amount" under section 68(1)(c). At [36], Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) stated (possibly in obiter, though the reasons do appear to have informed the Court's ultimate decision):</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[36]</span> The respondent referred us to <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em>. In that case a document which was not an invoice was found to be a payment claim, even though it did not expressly request payment of the identified amount. The single judge in that case identified that s 68(1)(b) and s 68(1)(c) of the BIFA imposed independent requirements, both of which had to be met, and that the section had to be read to give s 68(1)(c) "work to do" â€” [132]. In that case the judge was prepared to find that the documentation impliedly included a request for payment because the document was headed "Progress Claim"; gave a figure for a "Total Progress Claim Value for the Month (Incl GST)"; was annotated to the effect that "This Progress Claim is submitted under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017 â€¦", and was accompanied by a statutory declaration which, like the declaration here, recited that the statutory declaration was made "in connection with the payment of Progress Claim No â€¦". While I cannot see any relevant distinction between the documents in this case and the documents in <em>Iris Broadbeach Business</em>, I am afraid that I am not persuaded by the analysis in that case. I do not think it can be said that the documents comprising the email and attachments of 30 June 2023 made a request for payment, independently of identifying the amount the subject of the claim.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Based on <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, it would appear that stating a payment claim is made under the BIF Act is not, by itself, sufficient to meet the requirement of section 68(1)(c).</p>

          <p>That said, the District Court of Queensland in <em>Starline Interiors Pty Ltd v Tomkins Commercial and Industrial Builders Pty Ltd</em> [2025] QDC 63 (at [22]â€“[34]) held a document that included the words "payment claim" and stated "This is a payment claim made under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017" was valid. Kent KC DCJ distinguished Dalton JA's findings in <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94 on the basis that, among other things, the documents in <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 16 that her Honour appeared to opine were not sufficient to request payment under section 68(1)(c) contained the words "progress claim" rather than "payment claim". There were other reasons supporting the validity of the payment claim in this case, including that the document included the words "net payment claimed", where the past participle "claimed" implies a request for payment.</p>

          <h3>Adjudication examples</h3>
          <p><strong>Elite Earthmoving & Civil Pty Ltd v QLD Built Pty Ltd (Adj No 2881547)</strong> â€“ The phrase "Contract Inv" on the document was held insufficient to satisfy section 68(1)(c). The adjudicator reasoned that section 68(3) deems a document bearing the word "invoice" to request payment; shorthand ("Inv") isn't within the text of the statute. Accordingly, the adjudicator found she had no jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong>J Hutchinson Pty Ltd v Eve Co Aust Pty Ltd (Adj No 2794290)</strong> â€“ Although the document did not appear to be a formal tax invoice, and the word "invoice" was not prominent on the face of the document, the adjudicator held that mere inclusion of the word "invoice" anywhere in the written document is enough under section 68(3) to satisfy section 68(1)(c).</p>

          <p><strong>Croudace Greenhouses International Pty Ltd v Hansen Yuncken Pty Limited (Adj No 2756369)</strong> â€“ The payment claim did not request payment of the claimed amount and did not bear the word "invoice". Applying <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the adjudicator found that headings and statements such as "Progress Claim is made for paymentâ€¦", references to a "Total" figure, BIF Act endorsement, and a statutory declaration did not independently amount to a request for payment under section 68(1)(c). Accordingly, the adjudicator found he had no jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong>Melrose Built Pty Ltd v 114 Edward Pty Ltd (Adj No 2588358)</strong> â€“ The adjudicator held that the narration "TOTAL PAYABLE (Excluding GST)" in the progress claim satisfied (expressly or clearly implied) the section 68(1)(c) request requirement, including because the words "total payable" (having regard to the ordinary meaning of "payable") go further than "amount due" and amount to an implied request for payment.</p>

          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Include the word "invoice" or a phrase to the effect of "this is a request for payment under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017 (Qld)" (or both).</li>
            <li>If relying only on the word "invoice", while it is probably not strictly necessary for the payment claim to be a valid tax invoice, best practice may be to ensure the document complies with the formal requirements of a tax invoice (e.g. state the claimant's name and ABN, identify which supplies are taxable supplies and the relevant amounts of GST payable, include a date of issue, etc.).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of a payment claim</h4>
          <h2>Claim for a valid reference date</h2>
          <p>This is a critical jurisdictional requirement. A payment claim can only be made on and from a "reference date," which is determined by the contract or, if the contract is silent, by the default provisions in the Act. A claim made without a valid reference date (e.g., claiming twice for the same date) is invalid.</p>

        <section id="pc-license">
          <h4 class="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of a payment claim</h4>
          <h2>Not be for unlicensed building work</h2>
          <p>A payment claim cannot be made for construction work carried out by an unlicensed person if the QBCC Act requires that person to be licensed to carry out that work. This is a common jurisdictional challenge in adjudication.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="pc-timing">
          <h4 class="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of a payment claim</h4>
          <h2>Within six months of work</h2>
          <p>A payment claim (other than a final claim) must be given within 6 months after the construction work to which the claim relates was last carried out. This is a strict time bar, and claims served outside this period are invalid.</p>

        <!-- === Requirements of a payment schedule === -->
        <section id="ps-identify">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of a payment schedule</h4>
          <h2>Identify the payment claim</h2>
          <p>The payment schedule must clearly identify the payment claim to which it is responding. This is usually done by referencing the claim's date, invoice number, or project reference.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="ps-reasons">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of a payment schedule</h4>
          <h2>Reasons for withholding payment</h2>
          <p>This is the most critical requirement. If the respondent proposes to pay less than the full amount claimed (even if they propose to pay $0), they must state all their reasons for withholding payment. These reasons must be articulated with sufficient detail for the claimant to understand the case against them. A respondent is bound by these reasons at adjudication and cannot introduce new ones later.</p>

        <section id="aa-form">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Form S79</h2>

        <section id="aa-identify">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Identify the claim/schedule</h2>
          <p>The application must identify the payment claim and the payment schedule (if any) to which it relates. Copies of these documents must be attached.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="aa-fee">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Pay prescribed fee</h2>
          <p>The claimant must pay the application fee charged by the ANA. Failure to pay the fee means the application is not considered "made" and may fall out of time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="aa-corners">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Not outside four corners</h2>
          <p>The adjudication application (including its submissions) cannot raise new claims or reasons that were not included in the original payment claim. The application is limited to the issues and amounts claimed in the payment claim and responded to in the payment schedule.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- === Requirements of an adjudication response === -->
        <section id="ar-reasons">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication response</h4>
          <h2>Not exceed reasons for withholding payment</h2>
          <p>An adjudication response can only include reasons for withholding payment that were first raised in the payment schedule. A respondent cannot introduce new arguments, new expert reports, or new reasons for non-payment at this stage. This is why the payment schedule is so important.</p>

        <section id="s-pc">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of payment claim</h2>
          <p>The payment claim must be served on the person liable to make the payment, as identified in the contract. Service must be in accordance with the contract's "notice" provisions (e.g., to a specific email address or physical address).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="s-ps">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of payment schedule</h2>

        <section id="d-consider">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>What the Adjudicator must consider</h2>
          <p>The adjudicator *must* consider the provisions of the BIF Act, the contract, the payment claim, the payment schedule, the adjudication application, and the adjudication response (and all submissions and evidence properly included within them).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="d-not-consider">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>What the Adjudicator must not consider</h2>
          <p>The adjudicator *must not* consider an adjudication response that was not served on time. They also *must not* consider any reasons for withholding payment that were not included in the payment schedule. This is the key "four corners" doctrine of security of payment.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="d-timing">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>Timing of decision</h2>
          <p>An adjudicator must make their decision within 10 business days of receiving the adjudication response, or within a longer period if agreed by the parties. This tight timeframe is a key feature of the "pay now, argue later" regime.</p>
Note: I noticed a small typo in your provided HTML (`class_name=` instead of `class=`) for the breadcrumb headings. I have corrected this in the code below for sections `ps-identify` and onwards.
