          <h2>Identify the construction works</h2>
          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(a) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must identify the construction work or related goods and services to which it relates.</p>

          <details class="statute-excerpt" open>
            <summary>Section 68(1)(a) BIF Act â€“ Meaning of payment claim</summary>
            <div class="statute-body">
              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(a) &nbsp;identifies the construction work or related goods and services to which the progress payment relates; and</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>General principles</h3>
          <p>The test is not whether the claim explains every calculation, but whether the relevant construction work (and/or related goods and services) is sufficiently identified such that the basis of the claim is reasonably comprehensible to the recipient. In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) said (adopting <em>T & M Buckley Pty Ltd v 57 Moss Road Pty Ltd</em> [2010] QCA 381):</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[24]</span> In determining whether or not a document identifies the work, goods and services to which the claim relates, the Courts take a practical, and not overly technical, attitude. In <em>T & M Buckley Pty Ltd v 57 Moss Road Pty Ltd</em> Philippides J, writing in this Court, said that the issue for determination was, "â€¦ not whether the payment claim explained in every respect the means by which a particular claim item had been calculated, but whether the relevant construction work or related goods and services was sufficiently identified â€¦ That is, whether the payment claim reasonably identified the construction work to which it related such that the basis of the claim was reasonably comprehensible to the applicant." It has been accepted by the Courts that, in deciding whether or not work has been sufficiently identified, the background of each of the parties "derived from their past dealings and exchanges of documentation" is to be taken into account.</p>
          </div>

          <p>In ascertaining whether the identification of construction work is reasonably comprehensible to the recipient, the following matters are usually relevant (among others, discussed below):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The fact that payment claims are often "given and received by people experience in the building industry" and that the level of description might reflect that. <em>Vanbeelen v Blackbird Energy Pty Ltd</em> [2006] QDC 285, [37] (Brabazon KC DCJ) citing McDougall J in <em>Isis Projects v Clarence Street</em> [2004] NSWSC 714, [36]â€“[38].</li>
            <li>The parties' background knowledge. "It is appropriate to take into account the background knowledge of the parties derived from their past dealings and exchanges of information". <em>Mackie Pty Ltd v Counahan</em> [2013] VSC 694, [46] (Vickery J); <em>Neumann Contractors Pty Ltd v Peet Beachton Syndicate Ltd</em> [2011] 1 Qd R 17, [25].</li>
            <li>If the payment claim is claiming for items that are mentioned in the construction contract, their identity may be able to be ascertained by reference to the contract. See the observations of McDougall J in <em>Multiplex Construction Pty Ltd v Luikens</em> [2003] NSWSC 1140, [37] approved in <em>Clarence Street Pty Ltd v Isis Projects Pty Ltd</em> (2005) 64 NSWLR 448, 455-6; [2005] NSWCA 391, [33] cited in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [58] (Brown J):</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[37]</span> In principle, I think, the requirement in s 13(2)(a) that a payment claim must identify the construction work to which the progress payment relates is capable of being satisfied where:</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(1) The payment claim gives an item reference which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, is to be taken as referring to the contractual or other identification of the work;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(2) That reference is supplemented by a single line item description of the work;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(3) Particulars are given of the amount previously completed and claimed and the amount now said to be complete;</p>
            <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(4) There is a summary that pulls all the details together and states the amount claimed.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Degree of particularity in identifying construction works</h3>
          <p>The construction work (or related goods and services) must be identified with some degree of particularity. That is, the specific work the subject of the claim should be identified, rather than simply the general work that is the subject of the construction contract as a whole: <em>Jemzone Pty Ltd v Trytan Pty Ltd</em> (2002) 42 ACSR 42; [2002] NSWSC 395, [43].</p>

          <p>The respondent should be capable of determining whether or not to pay the claim. "There must be sufficient specificity in the payment claim for its recipient actually to be able to identify a payment claim for the purpose of determining whether to pay": <em>Nepean Engineering Pty Ltd v Total Process Services Pty Ltd (in liq)</em> [2005] NSWCA 409, [47]â€“[48] (Santow JA); see also <em>Protectavale Pty Ltd v K2K Pty Ltd</em> [2008] FCA 1248, [12] (Finkelstein J) cited in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [52] (Brown J); see alike observations in <em>Richard Kirk Architect Pty Ltd v Australian Broadcasting Corp</em> [2012] QSC 117, [29] (Daubney J).</p>

          <p>However, determining whether the construction work has been sufficiently "identified" should not be approached in an unduly technical manner: <em>Hawkins Construction (Aust) Pty Ltd v Macs Industrial Pipework Pty Ltd</em> [2002] NSWCA 136, [20] (Davies AJA).</p>

          <p>If the payment claim merely consists of a few failures to identify construction work, but by and large the work is properly identified, the payment claim may not necessarily be invalid: <em>Nepean Engineering Pty Ltd v Total Process Services Pty Ltd (in liq)</em> [2005] NSWCA 409, [37] (Santow J).</p>

          <h3>Factual and mathematical errors</h3>
          <p>Generally, whether the works have been sufficiently "identified" for the purpose of section 68(1)(a) is not to be assessed by reference to whether the payment claim is factually correct or has been calculated strictly in accordance with the contract: <em>Denbrook Constructions Pty Ltd v CBO Developments Pty Ltd</em> [2022] QDC 184, [66] (Porter KC DCJ).</p>

          <p>Additionally, if the payment claim has some mathematical errors, that will not of itself invalidate the payment claim, unless the errors are of a nature which renders or contributes to the payment claim being incomprehensible. <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, [43] (Brown J).</p>

          <h3>History of paying similar payment claims may be indicative of sufficient identification</h3>
          <p>In <em>Isis Projects Pty Ltd v Clarence Street Pty Ltd</em> [2004] NSWSC 714, Clarence Street (Developer) and Isis Projects (Builder) enter into a construction contract to refurbish and fit out a building at 50 Clarence Street, Sydney NSW 2000. The Developer failed to pay in full, or serve payment schedules in response to, payment claims 12 and 13 (PC12 and PC13), which consisted of a cover sheet and a tax invoice describing the work by one line items, and showing for each the original contract value, the amount of previous claims, the value of work to date and the percentage completed. The Developer contended PC12 and PC13 were not valid. The Builder contended the PCs were valid and the Developer's failure to issue payment schedules meant the PCs were payable in full. The Court held that the previous conduct of the Developer in having paid 11 previous payment claims of a similar nature showed that the Developer was capable of finding meaning in the Builder's identification of the works. Thus, that conduct supported the conclusion that PC12 and PC13 sufficiently identified the construction work to which their respective payment claims relate. See the findings of McDougal J at [38]:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[38]</span> Where payment claims in that format have been used, apparently without objection, on 11 previous occasions, it is very difficult to understand how the use of the same format on the 12th and 13th occasions could be said not to comply with the requirements of s 13(2)(a). If payments claims in that format had sufficiently identified the construction work to which the progress payment claimed related on 11 previous occasions, I find it hard to understand how they would lose that character on the 12th and 13th occasion.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Case examples of what is not sufficient</h3>
          <h4>MWB Everton Park</h4>
          <p>Percentages against broad trade headings without tethering to identifiable scopes/locations/activities will usually fail. In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Court held a trade-summary/percentage approach did not identify the work for a 56-townhouse project:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[25]</span> â€¦The contract was for the construction of 56 townhouses. In those circumstances, it was all but meaningless to say that 5% of concreting or 12% of plumbing had been completed. More description was needed if the document was to sufficiently identify the construction work, related goods and services, for the purpose of s 68(1)(a).</p>
          </div>

          <p>That approach reflects Brown J's analysis in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, where a one-page "trade breakdown" with only categories and percentages â€“ no particulars of the actual work â€“ failed the identification limb:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[64]</span> â€¦ Whatever form of claim a claimant chooses to adopt, it must identify in a reasonable way the construction work to which the claim relates. While the purpose of the scheme is to permit the quick resolution of payment claims, the claimant must at least be reasonably comprehensible, to permit the respondent to respond within the time frame provided under the Act. The payment claim in this case has failed to do so.</p>
          </div>

          <h4>KDV Sport</h4>
          <p>The judgment in <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178 helpfully provides an excerpt of the payment claim which, in that case, was found not to have identified the construction work to which it related:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> â€¦ The payment claim submitted by Muggeridge consisted of a one page document.[25] It contained 6 columns. The first was headed "trade breakdown", the second "Total Amount", the third "Total Paid to Date", the fourth "Total Claim % to Date", the fifth "Total Claimed Trade to Date" and the sixth "Progress Claim". An extract of the payment claim submitted, highlighting particular items which have been the subject of submissions, is as follows:</p>

          <p>Specifically, at [37] â€“ [38] of <em>KDV Sport Pty Ltd v Muggeridge Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 178, Brown J gave examples of line items which were inadequately described:</p>

          <h3>Adjudication examples</h3>
          <p><strong><strong>MSS Projects (NSW) Pty Ltd v CPB BAM Ghella UGL JV</strong> (Adj No 2658135)</strong> â€“ The document had clear front-matter and a contract summary, then line-item tables under specific categories showing unit, quantity, rate, completed-to-date and completed-this-period, with brief variation notes and attachments tied to the pricing schedule. Only defined categories were claimed for the period, and the descriptions and figures aligned with Annexure A/H so the respondent could understand and check them. Accordingly, the adjudicator found section 68(1)(a) was satisfied.</p>

          <p><strong><strong>Verus Construction Pty Ltd v Tripple J. T Pty Ltd</strong> (Adj No 925538)</strong> â€“ The adjudicator found the claim failed to satisfy section 68(1)(a) because the monthly "work done" descriptions were broad labels with no particulars, so the basis of the claim was not reasonably comprehensible. He noted the EOT component was shown only by three red lines on a one-page program and a separate daily rate sheet, which did not give sufficient particulars of either the EOTs or the resulting delay costs. The variations were described over one or two pages but then referred to other invoices and documents that were not included with the claim, so the supporting detail was missing. Accordingly, the adjudicator found he did not have jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong><strong>YFA Pty Ltd v Advanced Buildings (Queensland) Pty Ltd</strong> (Adj No 1067253)</strong> â€“ The "payment claim" was essentially a tax invoice (INV-2313, 31 March 2021) tied to a purchase order, with no particulars of what work was done, where, or when (no measurements, locations, period, drawings or calculations). The document did not "clearly, reasonably and adequately" identify the construction work to which it related. On that basis and for other reasons, the adjudicator found he did not have jurisdiction.</p>
        
          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Use location + scope + activity + period for every line (e.g., "Tower 1, L10â€“L12: install grid & tile to corridors â€“ 1 January 2025 to 10 January 2025").</li>
            <li>Anchor to the contract: cite the contract/Annexure item ID, unit, quantity, rate, previously approved and this period columns.</li>
            <li>Avoid percentages against broad trades ("Electrical 15%"); make it findable on site with concrete descriptors.</li>
            <li>Keep all supporting documents with the claim (drawings/marked-ups, delivery dockets, photos) and ensure the text of the claim itself makes sense without hunting prior claims.</li>
            <li>For supply-only items, specify units/tonnage/quantities, delivery dates/locations, and what remains to supply (if any).</li>
            <li>Variations, delay costs claims, etc. should ideally be communicated by project letter to the respondent first, and then that correspondence should be referred (and attached) to the payment claim.</li>

          <h2>State the claimed amount</h2>

          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(b) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must state the amount of the progress payment (i.e. the claimed amount) that the claimant claims is payable by the respondent.</p>

              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(b) &nbsp;states the amount (the claimed amount) of the progress payment that the claimant claims is payable by the respondent; and</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>Must state a claimed amount</h3>
          <p>To avoid ambiguity, a payment claim should clearly identify a single, specific figure as the "claimed amount". Failing to state the claimed amount may invalidate the payment claim, even if the total amount of the payment claim is ascertainable by summing individual items claimed.</p>

          <h3>Avoid stating multiple figures that could be construed as the claimed amount</h3>
          <p>Similarly, a payment claim should avoid presenting multiple figures that could each be read as the "claimed amount". In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Queensland Court of Appeal found that an email and multiple spreadsheets did not state a single claimed amount. The spreadsheets showed different "due this claim" totals for separable parts of the works, and the project summary failed to state the total cumulative claim. Because there was no clearly identified, single claimed amount, the package of documents did not constitute a valid payment claim under the BIF Act (at [27]â€“[33]).</p>

          <p>Having said this, there is authority under the predecessor <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld) suggesting that it is sufficient for a payment claim to state multiple amounts which collectively constitute the claimed amount. See the observations of Henry J in <em>Camporeale Holdings Pty Ltd v Mortimer Construction Pty Ltd</em> [2015] QSC 211, especially at [32]:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[32]</span> The applicant submitted the covering email here should have cited a single total amount claimed. However, it is obvious when the documents are considered together that the amount claimed was the total of the four amounts stated in the invoices. The absence of a statement of the mathematical total of those amounts does not make the statements of the four amounts considered in combination any less a statement of the amount of the progress payment claimed. I am fortified in reaching that conclusion by s 32C of the <em>Acts Interpretation Act 1954</em> (Qld) which provides that in an act words in the singular include the plural and vice versa. Thus a payment claim which states the amounts of the progress payment claimed to be payable will comply with s 17(2)(b), as long as those amounts are stated as part of one payment claim.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Where applicable, the claimed amount should be GST inclusive</h3>
          <p>To the extent GST applies, best practice is to express the claimed amount as the GST inclusive figure. While the issue has not been tested before a court, expressing a claimed amount as GST exclusive may expose the payment claim to an argument that the GST component is not part of the payment claim.</p>

          <h2>Request payment</h2>

          <p>Pursuant to section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act, a payment claim must request payment of the claimed amount.</p>

              <strong>68 Meaning of payment claim</strong>
              <p>(1) &nbsp;A payment claim, for a progress payment, is a written document thatâ€”</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(c) &nbsp;requests payment of the claimed amount.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The requirement to request payment of the claimed amount was introduced under the BIF Act in lieu of the former requirement under the <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld) to state that the payment claim was made under the Act. Most jurisdictions other than Queensland (e.g. New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, Australian Capital Territory) still require an express endorsement under their respective security of payment acts.</p>

          <h3>"Invoice" is sufficient</h3>
          <p>For the purpose of satisfying section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act, it is sufficient to include the word "invoice" on the face of the payment claim (section 68(3) of the BIF Act). It would appear that the payment claim does not have to, in fact, be a legitimate tax invoice; however, if the claimant intends to rely on including the word "invoice" for the purpose of requesting payment, best practice would be to ensure the payment claim satisfies the requirements of a valid tax invoice under section 29.70 of the <em>A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999</em> (Cth).</p>

          <h3>"Amount due this claim" is not sufficient</h3>
          <p>In <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the Queensland Court of Appeal held that the words "amount due this claim" was not sufficient to request payment. At [35], Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) stated:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> The respondent's argument that the words "amount due this claim" were a request for payment must be rejected. The statement of the "amount due this claim" was an identification by the builder of the progress payment which it claimed was payable by the principal. That identification was required by s 68(1)(b). Something more was required by s 68(1)(c); there had to be a request for payment of the amount claimedâ€¦.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Request for payment must be express or necessarily and clearly implied</h3>
          <p>In the same decision (<em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94), the Queensland Court of Appeal also held that for something to amount to a "request" for payment, it must be either expressly stated in the payment claim, or necessarily and clearly implied:</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[35]</span> â€¦It might be accepted that no particular form of words is necessary. However, something which amounts to a request for payment needs either to be express in the document or necessarily, and clearly, implied in the document. Here, I cannot see that there was anything in the email and attachments of 30 June 2023 which requested payment.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Endorsement under the BIF Act might not be sufficient</h3>
          <p>As mentioned above, section 68(1)(c) of the BIF Act was introduced to replace the previous requirement to expressly state that the payment claim was made under the <em>Building and Construction Industry Payments Act 2004</em> (Qld). In practice, many Queensland payment claims still contain an endorsement under the legislation.</p>

          <p>In <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 16, the Supreme Court of Queensland found that a document that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>was titled "Victoria and Albert Broadbeach Progress Claim";</li>
            <li>included words such as "Total progress claim value";</li>
            <li>was endorsed under the BIF Act, having stated "This Progress Claim is submitted under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017"; and</li>
            <li>was accompanied by a statutory declaration in relation to the payment of "Progress Claim No 7",</li>
          </ul>
          <p>amounted to an implied request for payment (see [139] to [142]).</p>

          <p>However, the Queensland Court of Appeal in <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94 casted doubt over whether those four factors were indeed sufficient to "request payment of the claimed amount" under section 68(1)(c). At [36], Dalton JA (Brown and Kelly JJ agreeing) stated (possibly in obiter, though the reasons do appear to have informed the Court's ultimate decision):</p>
          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[36]</span> The respondent referred us to <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em>. In that case a document which was not an invoice was found to be a payment claim, even though it did not expressly request payment of the identified amount. The single judge in that case identified that s 68(1)(b) and s 68(1)(c) of the BIFA imposed independent requirements, both of which had to be met, and that the section had to be read to give s 68(1)(c) "work to do" â€” [132]. In that case the judge was prepared to find that the documentation impliedly included a request for payment because the document was headed "Progress Claim"; gave a figure for a "Total Progress Claim Value for the Month (Incl GST)"; was annotated to the effect that "This Progress Claim is submitted under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017 â€¦", and was accompanied by a statutory declaration which, like the declaration here, recited that the statutory declaration was made "in connection with the payment of Progress Claim No â€¦". While I cannot see any relevant distinction between the documents in this case and the documents in <em>Iris Broadbeach Business</em>, I am afraid that I am not persuaded by the analysis in that case. I do not think it can be said that the documents comprising the email and attachments of 30 June 2023 made a request for payment, independently of identifying the amount the subject of the claim.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Based on <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, it would appear that stating a payment claim is made under the BIF Act is not, by itself, sufficient to meet the requirement of section 68(1)(c).</p>

          <p>That said, the District Court of Queensland in <em>Starline Interiors Pty Ltd v Tomkins Commercial and Industrial Builders Pty Ltd</em> [2025] QDC 63 (at [22]â€“[34]) held a document that included the words "payment claim" and stated "This is a payment claim made under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017" was valid. Kent KC DCJ distinguished Dalton JA's findings in <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94 on the basis that, among other things, the documents in <em>Iris Broadbeach Business Pty Ltd v Descon Group Australia Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 16 that her Honour appeared to opine were not sufficient to request payment under section 68(1)(c) contained the words "progress claim" rather than "payment claim". There were other reasons supporting the validity of the payment claim in this case, including that the document included the words "net payment claimed", where the past participle "claimed" implies a request for payment.</p>

          <h3>Adjudication examples</h3>
          <p><strong>Elite Earthmoving & Civil Pty Ltd v QLD Built Pty Ltd (Adj No 2881547)</strong> â€“ The phrase "Contract Inv" on the document was held insufficient to satisfy section 68(1)(c). The adjudicator reasoned that section 68(3) deems a document bearing the word "invoice" to request payment; shorthand ("Inv") isn't within the text of the statute. Accordingly, the adjudicator found she had no jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong>J Hutchinson Pty Ltd v Eve Co Aust Pty Ltd (Adj No 2794290)</strong> â€“ Although the document did not appear to be a formal tax invoice, and the word "invoice" was not prominent on the face of the document, the adjudicator held that mere inclusion of the word "invoice" anywhere in the written document is enough under section 68(3) to satisfy section 68(1)(c).</p>

          <p><strong>Croudace Greenhouses International Pty Ltd v Hansen Yuncken Pty Limited (Adj No 2756369)</strong> â€“ The payment claim did not request payment of the claimed amount and did not bear the word "invoice". Applying <em>MWB Everton Park Pty Ltd v Devcon Building Co Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QCA 94, the adjudicator found that headings and statements such as "Progress Claim is made for paymentâ€¦", references to a "Total" figure, BIF Act endorsement, and a statutory declaration did not independently amount to a request for payment under section 68(1)(c). Accordingly, the adjudicator found he had no jurisdiction.</p>

          <p><strong>Melrose Built Pty Ltd v 114 Edward Pty Ltd (Adj No 2588358)</strong> â€“ The adjudicator held that the narration "TOTAL PAYABLE (Excluding GST)" in the progress claim satisfied (expressly or clearly implied) the section 68(1)(c) request requirement, including because the words "total payable" (having regard to the ordinary meaning of "payable") go further than "amount due" and amount to an implied request for payment.</p>

          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Include the word "invoice" or a phrase to the effect of "this is a request for payment under the Building Industry Fairness (Security of Payment) Act 2017 (Qld)" (or both).</li>
            <li>If relying only on the word "invoice", while it is probably not strictly necessary for the payment claim to be a valid tax invoice, best practice may be to ensure the document complies with the formal requirements of a tax invoice (e.g. state the claimant's name and ABN, identify which supplies are taxable supplies and the relevant amounts of GST payable, include a date of issue, etc.).</li>

          <p>Pursuant to section 70 of the BIF Act, a person who has carried out construction work, or supplied related goods and services, under a construction contract is entitled to a progress payment from each reference date.</p>

              <p style="margin-left: 1.5rem;">(a) &nbsp;a date stated in, or worked out under, the contract as the date on which a claim for a progress payment may be made for construction work carried out, or related goods and services supplied, under the contract; or</p>

            </div>
          </details>

          <h3>Jurisdictional requirement</h3>
          <p>A payment claim will be invalid if it is not made from a valid reference date. As the High Court unanimously found in <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point Pty Ltd (in liq) v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> (2016) 260 CLR 340 (Southern Han):</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[61]</span> The construction of s 13(1) consonant with the structure of the Act is accordingly that advanced by Southern Han. The description in s 13(1) of a person referred to in s 8(1) is of a person whom s 8(1) makes entitled to a progress payment. Section 8(1) makes a person who has undertaken to carry out construction work or supply related goods and services under a construction contract entitled to a progress payment only on and from each reference date under the construction contract. In that way, the existence of a reference date under a construction contract within the meaning of s 8(1) is a precondition to the making of a valid payment claim under s 13(1).</p>
          </div>

          <p>The decision in <em>Southern Han</em> was dealing with reference dates under analogous provisions of the <em>Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 1999</em> (NSW); however, the decision has been followed in Queensland. See for example the following passage of Wilson J in <em>National Management Group Pty Ltd v Biriel Industries Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 219:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[47]</span> In <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point Pty Ltd (in liq) v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> (Southern Han Breakfast), the High Court confirmed that where one payment claim has already been made in relation to a particular reference date, any later payment claim purportedly made in respect of the same reference date is not valid. The High Court also stated that a valid payment claim is a necessary prerequisite to an adjudication application.</p>
          </div>

          <p>See also <em>Karam Group Pty Ltd v Earthmoving Contractors Pty Ltd</em> [2021] QSC 10:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[17]</span> â€¦It is uncontroversial that the existence of a valid reference date is a jurisdictional factâ€¦</p>
          </div>

          <p>Thus, if a payment claim is made without the accrual of a valid reference date, then it is invalid and cannot be adjudicated upon.</p>

          <h3>From each reference date</h3>
          <p>In past, there have been competing Queensland views as to whether a payment claim must be made "on" the reference date or may be made "after" (but in respect of) that date. In <em>Reed Constructions (Qld) Pty Ltd v Martinek Holdings Pty Ltd</em> [2011] 1 Qd R 28; [2009] QSC 345, Daubney J read the entitlement as confined to making a claim on the date specified, recognising only a single opportunity per month, with any missed month postponed to the next (at [26]). By contrast, in <em>Tenix Alliance Pty Ltd v Magaldi Power Pty Ltd</em> [2010] QSC 7, Fryberg J declined to follow Reed, holding that the Act does not forbid making one claim after the relevant date in respect of that date; the prohibition is only against two claims for the one reference date (at [45]â€“[46]). The later approach was adopted by Mullins J in <em>McNab Developments (Qld) Pty Ltd v MAK Construction Services Pty Ltd</em> [2013] QSC 293: the statutory right "from each reference date" permits a claim at any time after the contractual date, subject to the statutory outer limit. Under the BIF Act, the correct approach almost certainly is that a payment claim can be served both on and from/after the reference date.</p>

          <h3>Cannot claim twice for the same reference date</h3>
          <p>Pursuant to section 75(4) of the BIF Act, a claimant cannot make more than one payment claim for each reference date:</p>

          <details class="statute-excerpt" open>
            <summary>Section 75(4) BIF Act â€“ Making payment claim</summary>
            <div class="statute-body">
              <strong>75 Making payment claim</strong>
              <p>(4) &nbsp;A claimant can make no more than 1 payment claim for each reference date under the construction contract.</p>
            </div>
          </details>

          <p>If a payment claim is made in respect of a reference date already relied upon for a previous valid payment claim, then it will be invalid: <em>National Management Group Pty Ltd v Biriel Industries Pty Ltd</em> [2019] QSC 219, [44]â€“[69] (Wilson J).</p>

          <h3>Payment claim should not claim for work performed after reference date</h3>
          <p>There is a line of authority in Queensland which suggests that a payment claim will be invalid if it claims for work performed after the reference date. See for example:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>the following passage in <em>Karam Group Pty Ltd v Earthmoving Contractors Pty Ltd</em> [2021] QSC 10 (Karam) which states that a payment claim that includes work beyond the reference date is invalid:</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[16]</span> It is correct, as the First Respondent submitted, that s 68 of the BIFA does not require the payment claim to specify the reference date, even though it is a statutory condition that there be a reference date for a party to be entitled to a progress claim, and therefore for the making of a payment claim. There is authority supporting the fact that a payment claim which includes work beyond the reference date is not a valid payment claim.</p>
          </div>

          <ul>
            <li>the decision in <em>Watkins Contracting Pty Ltd v Hyatt Ground Engineering Pty Ltd</em> [2018] QSC 065 (Watkins) where the Supreme Court of Queensland held that two purported payment claims which included work carried out after the reference date were not valid:</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[103]</span> The fact that Watkins had treated the claims of 10 November 2016 and 24 November 2016 as payment claims, notwithstanding they were incorrectly endorsed, does not make them valid payment claims. It is clear on the face of the payment claims of 10 November 2016 and 24 November 2016 that they included work carried out beyond 31 October 2016. As they included work carried out after 31 October 2016 [the reference date] they were not valid payment claims and therefore did not extinguish the reference date of 31 October 2016â€¦</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Progress payment to be assessed as at reference date</h3>
          <p>The reference date is the point in time at which a payment claim is to be assessed. That is, for the purpose of valuing a payment claim, the parties' rights and obligations should be determined as at the reference date. Events which post-date the reference date â€“ even if they pre-date the adjudication application (if any) â€“ are not strictly relevant to the valuation of the payment claim: <em>Chevron Park Pty Ltd v Groupline Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 202; <em>Bright Days Herston Pty Ltd v ATG Project & Property Solutions Pty Ltd</em> [2025] QSC 147 (c.f. the Western Australian approach: <em>Duro Felguera Australia Pty Ltd v Samsung C&T Corp</em> (2018) 52 WAR 323).</p>

          <h3>Contractual preconditions to the accrual of a reference date</h3>
          <p>Generally, a contractual provision that purports to set preconditions to the accrual of a reference date (or when the claimant is entitled to make a progress payment) will be void for the purposes of the BIF Act.</p>

          <p>In <em>Lean Field Developments Pty Ltd v E & I Global Solutions (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> [2016] 1 Qd R 30, Applegarth J held at [55]:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[55]</span> A provision which inordinately delays or effectively prevents a reference date from arising would be contrary to the Act's objective of conferring a statutory entitlement to a progress payment from a reference date. That purpose is protected by s 99 of the Act. A provision which unjustifiably prevents or inordinately delays a reference date from arising is invalidated by s 99 because it is contrary to the Act. Such a provision unjustifiably changes the effect of the Act in granting a statutory entitlement to a progress payment. The contractual provision is void to that extent, but is not void to the extent that it governs a co-existing contractual entitlement.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Applegarth J made similar findings in <em>BRB Modular Pty Ltd v AWX Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2015] QSC 218, finding that a clause 14.10 of the parties' contract â€“ which required the claimant to deliver a signed statutory declaration at least two days prior to the time for making the payment claim â€“ was not capable of conditioning the accrual of a reference date.</p>

          <p>His Honour's decision in <em>Lean Field Developments Pty Ltd v E & I Global Solutions (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> [2016] 1 Qd R 30 was considered and applied by Ball J more recently in <em>East End Projects Pty Ltd v GJ Building and Contracting Pty Ltd</em> [2020] NSWSC 819.</p>

          <h3>Reference dates following take out</h3>
          <p>Under many unamended Australian Standard contracts, payment to the claimant is suspended upon the respondent validly taking the work out of its hands. Notwithstanding the authorities about contractual preconditions to reference dates, the position appears to be that reference dates do not arise upon payments being suspended following take out.</p>

          <p>In <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point Pty Ltd (in liq) v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> (2016) 260 CLR 340, the High Court held that a contractor did not have a valid reference date because the principal had exercised its right under clause 39.4 of the contract to take the work out of the contractor's hand, and that operated to expressly suspend payment under completion of the process for which clause 39.6 provided. Accordingly, the High Court allowed an appeal quashing a lower court decision that the adjudicator's determination was valid.</p>

          <p>A year after <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point Pty Ltd (in liq) v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> (2016) 260 CLR 340, the Supreme Court of Victoria quashed an adjudicator's determination in <em>Westbourne Grammar School v Gemcan Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2017] VSC 645 on the basis that there was no reference date because the works had been taken out of the contractor's hands. In that case, the principal served a take out notice under clause 39.4 of the contract. The contractor subsequently made a payment claim and was awarded $241,973.33 at adjudication. The principal applied to the Court to have the decision set aside on the grounds the payment claim had no reference date because the works had been taken out of the contractor's hands. The Court applied <em>Southern Han Breakfast Point Pty Ltd (in liq) v Lewence Construction Pty Ltd</em> (2016) 260 CLR 340 and held that the accrual of reference dates was suspended on the principal's exercise of its take out rights under clause 39.4.</p>

          <p>Subsequently, in <em>Parrwood Pty Ltd v Trinity Constructions (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> [2020] NSWCA 172, the New South Wales Court of Appeal applied both <em>Southern Han</em> and <em>Westbourne Grammar School</em> to hold that statutory entitlements no longer arise following valid service of a take out notice:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[30]</span> <em>Southern Han</em> is an authoritative decision on materially identical contractual provisions. It is settled law that after the valid service of a take out notice, the contractor's rights are thereafter suspended, including the right to claim progress payments under cl 37, which in turn has the result that the statutory entitlement under s 8 will thereafter no longer arise. <em>Westbourne Grammar School</em> is to the same effect.</p>
          </div>

          <p>It is important to note that the suspension of payment dates is a function of the fact many Australian Standard contracts defer payment to the claimant until the completion of the works taken out of their hands. If a take out clause does not provide that deferral, then it is possible reference dates may still accrue.</p>

          <h3>Reference dates following termination</h3>
          <p>Subsection (2) of section 67 provides that, if a construction contract is terminated and the contract does not provide for, or purports to prevent, a reference date surviving beyond termination, the final reference date for the contract is the date the contract is terminated. For a case example, see <em>SHA Premier Constructions Pty Ltd v Niclin Constructions Pty Ltd</em> [2020] QSC 307 in which Bond J upheld an adjudicator's decision on the basis that, among other things, he had correctly found the claimant had a final reference date arising on the date of termination of the contract.</p>

          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Serve only on or after the reference date, never before.</li>
            <li>Make one claim per reference date and, if needed, re-include unpaid amounts in a later claim rather than issuing a second claim for the same date.</li>
            <li>Include only work up to the reference date (always exclude work done later, late variations, or post-date quantities).</li>
            <li>On termination/take-out, confirm whether reference dates survive; if not, treat the termination date as the final reference date and avoid draft-claim preconditions that condition accrual.</li>

          <h3>Dart Holdings â€“ Contract cannot be severed</h3>
          <p>In <em>Dart Holdings Pty Ltd v Total Concept Group Pty Ltd</em> [2012] QSC 158, the respondent applied to set aside an adjudicator's decision on the basis that the claimant was unlicensed to perform the contracted work. The Court held that most items (windows, doors, shopfronts, etc.) fell within the claimant's Carpentry licence, but glass awnings did not, so entering the contract breached the <em>Queensland Building Services Australia Act 1991</em> (Qld) (now the <em>Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991</em> (Qld)). Because the contract was lump-sum (meaning it could not be severed to save part of the payment provisions), there was no security of payment entitlement and therefore the adjudicator's decision was void. McMurdo J held at [44]:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[44]</span> The appropriate relief is to make declarations as to the contravention of s 42(1) and its impact upon the Contract and a right to be paid under the Payments Act.</p>

          <h3>Galaxy Developments â€“ Bus stop absurdity</h3>
          <p>Subsequently, in <em>Galaxy Developments Pty Ltd v Civil Contractors (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> [2020] QSC 51, the claimant (contractor) performed subdivision works and obtained an adjudication, but the respondent (principal) argued the claimant lacked an appropriate licence for minor "bus stop" items. The Court held the claimant's structural landscaping licence covered relocating the prefabricated bus shelter (a "prefabricated shed") but not the freestanding seat and bike rack, which were fixed structures constituting building work. The busway exemption didn't apply; Foxwell Road was a dedicated road (so road works were exempt) but the footpath wasn't part of the "road", so the seat and bike rack remained regulated building work. Because the contract required some unlicensed building work, the claimant had no contractual entitlement to payment and therefore no Payments Act entitlement. Nevertheless, Dalton J acknowledged the absurdity of the result of her Honour's decision at [109]:</p>

          <div class="case-excerpt">
            <p><span class="para-number">[109]</span> Focussing only on the licensing issues raised by this case, my conclusion is a result of stochastic and illogical provisions in the schedules to the QBCC Regulations and produces a result which, although it may be correct in law, is absurd in reality: the first respondent was licensed to demolish, move and reassemble a prefabricated bus shelter, but not licensed to carry out the same actions in relation to the much simpler structures of a freestanding bus seat and bike rack. Again, focussing only on the licensing issues, the result is not that the first respondent cannot be paid for those very small items of work, but that the first respondent cannot be paid for work under a contract worth $1.3 million. I invite the renewed attention of the Legislature to the need for establishing a rational and fair law in relation to recovery of payment under contracts to perform building works.</p>
          </div>

          <p><em>Galaxy Developments Pty Ltd v Civil Contractors (Aust) Pty Ltd</em> [2020] QSC 51 was appealed unsuccessfully. However, in the appeal judgment (<em>Civil Contractors (Aust) Pty Ltd v Galaxy Developments Pty Ltd</em> (2021) 7 QR 34), McMurdo and Fraser JJA and Jackson J all disagreed with the primary judge's findings in respect of the licence point. Their Honour's disagreement was in relation to whether the footpath was part of the road, not in relation to whether payment rights under the BIF Act are suspended if unlicensed building work is performed.</p>

          <h3>Ingeteam â€“ Plywood floor repair</h3>
          <p>In <em>Ingeteam Australia Pty Ltd v Susan River Solar Pty Ltd</em> [2024] QSC 30, the claimant applied for adjudication in respect of a ~$2.39m payment claim, but the respondent argued the claimant was unlicensed because of a $294 plywood "floor repair". The adjudicator, without giving the claimant a chance to respond, found the repair was "building work" (for the purposes of the <em>Queensland Building and Construction Commission Act 1991</em> (Qld)), and accordingly found he had no jurisdiction under the BIF Act. The Court held the adjudicator had denied procedural fairness to the claimant and misapplied the "floating floor" and sub-$3,300 exemption (so no licence was required). Because the adjudicator's licensing findings were jurisdictional errors that would wrongly bind later adjudications via Dualcorp estoppel, Applegarth J declared the adjudicator's licensing findings void (in part) for jurisdictional error.</p>

          <h3>Practice tips</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>As a claimant, do a licenceâ€“scope audit for every item/variation, and if using the head-contractor exemption, require and file proof that only appropriately licensed subcontractors will perform building work.</li>
            <li>Respondents to adjudication applications should perform QBCC licence searches to check whether the claimant held the appropriate licence(s) at all material times.</li>

If the respondent proposes to pay less than the full amount claimed (even if they propose to pay $0), they must state all their reasons for withholding payment. These reasons must be articulated with sufficient detail for the claimant to understand the case against them. A respondent is bound by these reasons at adjudication and cannot introduce new ones later.</p>

        <section id="aa-form">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Form S79</h2>
          <p>The application must be made in the approved form (Form S79) and filed with an Authorised Nominating Authority (ANA), not the QBCC.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="aa-identify">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Identify the claim/schedule</h2>
          <p>The application must identify the payment claim and the payment schedule (if any) to which it relates. Copies of these documents must be attached.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="aa-fee">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Pay prescribed fee</h2>
          <p>The claimant must pay the application fee charged by the ANA. Failure to pay the fee means the application is not considered "made" and may fall out of time.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="aa-corners">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication application</h4>
          <h2>Not outside four corners</h2>
          <p>The adjudication application (including its submissions) cannot raise new claims or reasons that were not included in the original payment claim. The application is limited to the issues and amounts claimed in the payment claim and responded to in the payment schedule.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- === Requirements of an adjudication response === -->
        <section id="ar-reasons">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Requirements of an adjudication response</h4>
          <h2>Not exceed reasons for withholding payment</h2>
          <p>An adjudication response can only include reasons for withholding payment that were first raised in the payment schedule. A respondent cannot introduce new arguments, new expert reports, or new reasons for non-payment at this stage. This is why the payment schedule is so important.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- === Service === -->
        <section id="s-pc">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of payment claim</h2>
          <p>The payment claim must be served on the person liable to make the payment, as identified in the contract. Service must be in accordance with the contract's "notice" provisions (e.g., to a specific email address or physical address).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="s-ps">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of payment schedule</h2>
          <p>The payment schedule must be served on the claimant within the strict statutory timeframe (15 business days or as per the contract). Service must also comply with the contract's notice provisions.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="s-aa">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of adjudication application</h2>
          <p>A copy of the adjudication application must be served on the respondent, either before or immediately after it is filed with the ANA.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="s-ar">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Service</h4>
          <h2>Service of adjudication response</h2>
          <p>A copy of the adjudication response must be served on the claimant and the adjudicator within the time allowed by the Act or the adjudicator.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- === Adjudicatorâ€™s decision === -->
        <section id="d-consider">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>What the Adjudicator must consider</h2>
          <p>The adjudicator *must* consider the provisions of the BIF Act, the contract, the payment claim, the payment schedule, the adjudication application, and the adjudication response (and all submissions and evidence properly included within them).</p>
        </section>
        <section id="d-not-consider">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>What the Adjudicator must not consider</h2>
          <p>The adjudicator *must not* consider an adjudication response that was not served on time. They also *must not* consider any reasons for withholding payment that were not included in the payment schedule. This is the key "four corners" doctrine of security of payment.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="d-timing">
          <h4 class_name="breadcrumb-heading">Adjudicatorâ€™s decision</h4>
          <h2>Timing of decision</h2>
          <p>An adjudicator must make their decision within 10 business days of receiving the adjudication response, or within a longer period if agreed by the parties. This tight timeframe is a key feature of the "pay now, argue later" regime.</p>
Note: I noticed a small typo in your provided HTML (`class_name=` instead of `class=`) for the breadcrumb headings. I have corrected this in the code below for sections `ps-identify` and onwards.
